This update is meant to serve as a hotfix. This is *not* v3.0.0. That will be releasing later. This fixes some annoying bugs/bad UX and adds some support for SNES games on iOS, just so we can spend a little more time developing v3.0.0. Better SNES support will come with v3.0.0.

__Besides fixing SNES, no additional support for games has been added.__ 
  
**New Features**
- SNES games now run on iOS. However: you cannot change the volume, there are no cheats, and no save states. Those features will be supported in v3.
- SNES games now save.
- SNES games now support audio.
- SNES games now support custom keyboard bindings.
- Uses the new control system from v3, as it fixes many issues people were having with the old one. 
- You can now upload a game in the "Uploaded Games Saves" menu, found in Settings > Storage, to easily manage an uploaded game's save.
- You can now import saves without even having played a game, using the same feature as mentioned above.
- You can now delete saves from the "Uploaded Games Saves" menu.
- Controllers now support Joysticks

**Fixes**
- Fixed backups not working for some users.
- Fixed individual battery saves exporting to export proper .sav files.
- Controllers list now updates when you connect a controller on the Settings page.
- Only uploaded games' save files now show in the "Uploaded Games Saves" menu.
- GBA games render pixel-perfect, rather than the wonky mess it was before.
- Default "Hide Controls" setting is now based on whether the browser supports touch.
- Fixed issue where "Fill Screen" was being used, even if it wasn't enabled.
- Separated "Upload" from the add methods, as it does not add the game to your Library.
- Renamed "Upload" to "Files"
- Temporarily removed "Report Issue" button in Settings, just report issues to the Discord server for now (invite can be found at the bottom of Settings).
- Fixed some skin icons, which were pointing to non-existent assets.

**Misc.**
- Updated and cleaned up FAQ a bit. Questions and answers are much more modern.
