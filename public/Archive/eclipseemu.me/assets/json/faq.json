        "question": "Q: How does saving work in Eclipse, and what systems are supported?",
        "answer": "A: The systems that support saving are GBA, GBC, and GB. The NES does not support saving. Saving is done like it is on the original console: going into the game menus and using the save function. After using the in-game save function, tap Menu, then Save, then wait a few seconds for Eclipse to save your game progress to your device (thirty [30] seconds is safe enough).<br>A full (unofficial) compatibility list can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ronmDFH7XWPr359usVspv90G9jLiPA_t9EYHChglTrE/edit."

Go into the debugger menu, and various options would be available (such as the ability to create an issue with all important information pre-attached, the states of various settings, and some buttons to force Eclipse to run certain tasks."

      "question": "Q: What games are recommended?",
      "answer": "A: Look through your stuff and find a physical cartridge. If you have none, you are limited to homebrew games for legal reasons. Please don\"t pirate games when using Eclipse."
    },
    {
      "question": "Q: This ROM (added from a link) isn\"t working. Why isn\"t it?",
      "answer": "A: A good test is to first download the ROM locally and upload it to Eclipse directly. To do this, press the \"+\" button and tap Upload. Select your ROM from your files, and load it with the corresponding button.<br>- If the game is not a Gameboy Advance game and doesn \"t load, the ROM is probably bad or doesn\"t work with Eclipse.<br>- If it is and it doesn \"t, wait for the splash screen (it can take some time).<br>- If you see the splash screen and the Nintendo branding is gone or corrupted, the ROM file is not supported by Eclipse.<br>- If it works perfectly when uploaded, your issue is probably a bad URL.Make sure the URL downloads the ROM when it is visited and doesn \"t display a download button. We recommend that you use Dropbox to store your ROMs, not sites like Google Drive, MediaFire, or MEGA (which are not officially supported)."

    {
      "question": "Q: I made a repo or skin. How do I get it featured inside of Eclipse?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Q: I am uploading a ROM to Eclipse but it isn\"t saved to the main menu. Why?",
      "answer": "A: This is a technical limitation. iOS\"s MobileSafari (which is what many users use) limit localStorage space to ~50MB, while many games (especially GBA games) can use dozens of megabytes of space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Q: Does Eclipse work offline?",
      "answer": "A: Eclipse does work offline, but certain features (like repos and your game collection) will be disabled. To use a game offline, you need to upload it under \"+.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Q: Are save states stored for uploaded ROMs?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Q: Eclipse is slow for me. Why is that?",
        "answer": "A: On devices worse than an iPhone 6s (or comparable), Eclipse will be slow, even if emulators like Delta or RetroArch work fine. Since Eclipse is Web-based and web browsers aren\"t as powerful as native applications or programs, performance hiccups are to be expected."
    },
    {
        "question": "Q: What repos are recommended? Where can I find repos?",
        "answer": "A: Please look through the featured repos in-app."

    },
    {
        "question": "Q: How do I delete Eclipse? I installed it via the profile and can\"t delete it normally.",
        "answer": "A: Remove the profile in Settings > General > Profile.<br>We do not allow for home screen removal on the profile due to home screen removals not removing the profile in the progress, leaving it installed after Eclipse is seemingly deleted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Q: Does this work with [platform]?",
      "answer": "A: Probably. Just go to https://eclipseemu.me/, use the online version, and [platform permitting] add it to your home screen/launcher/desktop.<br>- For desktop platforms, our Electron clients should work.This includes win32, macOS, and GNU-Linux [deb provided]. They include Discord Rich Presence support!<br> - For Android - based OSes, you should be able to add Eclipse to your launcher in Chrome and other browsers.<br> - For iOS, either adding the web version to the home screen or using the profile works.They do the same thing but personally, I prefer adding the web version to the home screen.<br> - For Android / Amazon Fire TV, PS4, and Xbox One, it probably runs but it isn\"t fun to use (controls).<br> - For Apple TV, watchOS, and the * Nintendo Switch, there is currently no support and it will probably not run properly.<br> - For UWP / Microsoft Store, we do not have a client.<br> - For browsers without JavaScript, Eclipse will not work. Ensure JavaScript is enabled and a decent browser (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) are being used."
