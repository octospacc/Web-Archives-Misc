Please read and accept it in order to use Eclipse.\n              <br>\n              <h3>Copyright and Licensing</h3>\n              Eclipse does not condone the use of illegally obtained game ROMS, such as those found on the Internet or shared by others without permission. Eclipse requires that the games used were either obtained via you extracting the ROM yourself, be a homebrew ROM that offers a public download, or you otherwise have the rights to use the game. Our featured repos consist of free-to-use games, and we encourage that you host a repo on a home server to organize your game collection.\n              Using illegally obtained ROMs from any source, even if it is in a repo, is a violation of copyright law.\n              <h3>Legal Compliance</h3>\n              Eclipse reserves the right to block content, such as repos and skins, that violate any laws, such as copyright law.\n              Although we store little to no data on our users, in the case a warrant is recieved, we (or partners like GitHub) will comply with it. As of July 2018, we have not recieved any requests by law enforcement.\n              Eclipse's servers and primary development is done in the United States of America, and we will comply with American laws.\n              <h3>Tracking</h3>\n              Eclipse does not track the user, but partners such as CloudFlare might collect basic data in order to protect Eclipse from cyber-attacks.\n              In addition, our link shortener partners might collect data to improve advertisements served. To avoid our link shorteners, go to https://eclipseemu.me/play/ directly. Ads are not shown in-app.\n              <h3>Data Storage and Gameplay</h3>\n              All game storage data is stored locally on your device. You can export or import this data in Settings.\n              We do operate a CORS-induced mirroring service, located on the php.eclipseemu.me subdomain, that will allow your browser to download ROMs, JSON, and other resources. This mirrorer is to be used exclusively by those who have permission to do so from Zenith (Eclipse Team) and, while it does take a URL and (for Google Drive users) a token for auth, nothing is logged.\n              All emulation is done locally and on-device. Disconnecting from the Internet after downloading/launching a game will still allow for emulation of a game.\n              <h3>App Linking</h3>\n              In the Eclipse interface, you have the option to link with other data providers, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. Outside of the CORS mirror, which is required for auth and downloading the ROMs, we do not store any data.\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"list\">\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <a href=\"/setup/complete/\" class=\"item-link item-content popup-close\">\n                  <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                    <div class=\"item-title\">\n                      <span>Agree & Continue</span>\n                      <div class=\"item-footer\">You are required to agree to use Eclipse.</div>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n`;\n  },\n  styleScoped: false\n};"],"sourceRoot":""}
